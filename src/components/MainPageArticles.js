                <h2>Mount Timpanogas. The 11,000 foot giant right in Salt Lake's backyard</h2>
                <p>The Mount Timpanogas trailhead is located just 10 miles up Provo Canyon and is only an hour drive from 
                Salt Lake City. Mount Timp as it's referred to locally has breathtaking views and waterfalls on the way. Past the 
                halfway mark you will pass by a few small lakes and an actual glacier. From the top you can get a spectacular 
                view of Utah Valley and see the cities of Provo and Orem.</p>
                <p>The Hike is difficult and incredibly strenuous as the 6 mile route takes you up to the top and through
                several series of switchbacks. The lower part of the trail is paved or has a flat gravel path until you hit
                the first waterfall. Halfway up there is a shelter to take refuge from storms and it also hosts restroom facilities.
                The hike can take easily take 8 hours to make it up and back but is well worth it. Mount Timp is a definite winner and 
                if you're up to the challenge.</p>

                <h2>How To Pick A Good Hike</h2>
                <p>Picking a good hike can be a challenge. There are time constraints that you have. There are 
                limits to how far you can practically drive or travel. Maybe you have the time and getting there isn't an
                issue but you just can't quite decide. We'll discuss these obstacles and more along with good strategies for 
                making a good pick.</p>
                <p>We'll start by discussing the main factors that are going to affect you: time, travel, weather, distance, 
                and difficulty. In a practical sense once you decide how much total time you have to dedicate to traveling and
                the hike itself you can start making some progress. It doesn't matter what cool hike you plan on doing if you 
                don't have enough time to actually do it. Once you've done that pick 2 or at most 3 general areas that are within your 
                travel time to start looking for specific hikes. Pick your top two hikes in each area and see if the difficulty and 
                the length of the hikes are appropriate for your level and still fit in your time budget. If there are any issues with
                the time of year or if weather is particularly bad, then you may have to put that one on the backburner for now.</p>
                <p>Here's the hard part. You now should have 4-6 hikes that you really want to go on but which one do you
                choose? The trick then is to pick the top hike in each general area. Now you can compare your top hike in each
                general area as you'll be down to 2 or 3 hikes. The rest is up to you, good luck!</p>
